#  Legal Document Analyzer

The **Legal Document Analyzer** is an intelligent NLP-powered tool designed to process and analyze legal documents efficiently. It uses natural language processing techniques to **summarize**, **extract key points**, **identify definitions**, and **flag potential issues** in legal content. With **MLflow** integration, all analyses are logged for reproducibility and experiment tracking.

---

##  Features

- **Summarization**  
  Automatically generates concise summaries of lengthy legal documents.

- **Key Point Extraction**  
  Identifies and highlights critical elements such as parties, key dates, obligations, etc.

- **Issue Detection**  
  Flags ambiguous language, contradictions, missing sections, and insufficient details.

- **Definition Extraction**  
  Automatically extracts and organizes definitions found within the document.

- **MLflow Integration**  
  Tracks and logs metrics, summaries, and parameters to ensure reproducibility and experiment management.

- **MLflow** â€“ Experiment tracking and artifact logging  
- **Hugging Face Transformers**  
  - `facebook/bart-large-cnn` for summarization  
  - `deepset/roberta-base-squad2` for question answering  
- **SpaCy** â€“ Named Entity Recognition (NER)  
- **Scikit-learn** â€“ TF-IDF and cosine similarity  
- **Streamlit** â€“ Web UI for document uploads and analysis  
- **Regex** â€“ Legal definition pattern recognition  
- **NLTK** â€“ Sentence tokenization
